The code under this repository is meant to be opened from IntelliJ, since IntelliJ project contains:

1) Library dependencies.
2) Main, and "Test Pricer" configurations, which is used to run the main-routine, and the tests.

Two pricers are implemented PricerBS for Black-Scholes, and PricerMC for MonteCarlo.
The former only supports Vanilla, and the latter can handle different types of products
as long as they're correctly defined in Product***.java.

Two types of products are defined as per the assignment requirements, ProductVanilla and ProductBarrier.

Json-files are used to defined the inputs as below:

pricingParams.json: Contains the pricing-parameters for MonteCarlo such as the number of simulations and seed.
marketdata.json: Contains the market-data such as spot, vol, risk-free-rate, and quote-date.
productsVannia.json: Contains Vanilla option products.
productsBarrier.json: Contains Barrier option products.

The above files can contain multiple definitions (except for pricingParams.json),
and the main-routine goes through the permutation of all the entries.
